# JavaScript basic coding challenges


#### The challenges:

- **Find the missing number in an array:** Write a function that takes an array of integers as input, where all numbers in the array are consecutive except for one number that is missing. The function should return the missing number.

- **Find the minimum and maximum numbers in an array:** Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns an object with the minimum and maximum numbers in the array.

- **Find the first non-repeated character in a string:** Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeated character in the string. For example, `"aabbcdd"` should return `"c"`. You can use an object as a lookup directory to count the occurrences of each character in the string.

- **Create a class called `Person` with the following properties and methods:**
  - Properties:
    - `name` (string)
    - `age` (number)
    - `interests` (array of strings)
  - Methods:
    - `greeting()`: returns a string that says "Hi, my name is `name`."
    - `bio()`: returns a string that says "My name is `name`, I'm `age` years old, and my interests are `interests`."
